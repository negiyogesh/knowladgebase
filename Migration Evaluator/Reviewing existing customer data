**What To look for when you receive data:**
1. Are there multiple sheet? Does the scope make sense across all sheets? How many servers are there?
2. Do we have the provisioning of all servers?
3. Is there usage data?
4. Do the values make sanse (For example, is it MB or GB)? Are there duplicates?
5. What environment do these servers belong to?
6. Are any of these machines running Microsoft SQL?
